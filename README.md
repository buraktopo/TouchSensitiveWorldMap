## Project Overview

This project aims to create an interactive world map constructed from touch-sensitive wooden pieces. Each piece represents a different country or U.S. state and is equipped with a capacitive touch sensor. When a country or state is touched, the system detects the input and displays a corresponding photo album on a nearby digital display. This integration of traditional woodworking with modern touch-sensitive technology and digital displays creates an educational and engaging experience.

## Educational Value Added

The project offers a multifaceted educational experience, combining elements of computer engineering, digital electronics, and interactive design. It provides hands-on experience with capacitive touch sensors, microcontroller programming, system integration, and user interface design. The project also encourages learning about different countries and cultures through the displayed photo albums, making it a valuable educational tool in a classroom or museum setting.

## Tasks

*Research and selection of appropriate capacitive touch sensors.
*Development of a microcontroller-based system for sensor input processing.
*Design and programming of the user interface for the display.
*Integration of hardware and software components.
*Testing and troubleshooting the complete system.
*Documentation and presentation of the project.

## Design Decisions

*Selection of a microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi) based on I/O capability and ease of programming.
*Determination of sensor placement and sensitivity adjustment to ensure accurate touch detection through wood.
